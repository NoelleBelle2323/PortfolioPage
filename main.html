		<p>Hi, I'm a computer engineering and linguistics student at the University of Washington.
		   Like the majority of people in the programming sphere I have an interest in machine
		   learning. I also enjoy computer science education as well as the cross-section of
		   computer science and linguistics as a means of improving the world through a better
		   understanding of each other and how we interact with technology.</p>
